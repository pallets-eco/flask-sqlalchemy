Changelog
=========

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Flask-SQLAlchemy
release.

Version 3.0
-----------

In development, codename Dubnium

- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor.
- Fix minimum SQLAlchemy version requirement (0.8 or above), due to use
  of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Drop support of Flask < 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event.

Version 2.1
-----------

Released on October 23rd 2015, codename Caesium

- Table names are automatically generated in more cases, including
  subclassing mixins and abstract models.
- Allow using a custom MetaData object.
- Add support for binds parameter to session.

Version 2.0
-----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

- Changed how the builtin signals are subscribed to skip non Flask-SQLAlchemy
  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
- Added working table reflection support.
- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.

Version 1.0
-----------

Released on July 20th 2013, codename Aurum

- Added Python 3.3 support.
- Dropped 2.5 compatibility.

Version 0.11
------------

Version 0.10
------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.

  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
