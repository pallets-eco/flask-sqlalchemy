Changelog
=========

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Flask-SQLAlchemy
release.

Version 2.0
-----------

(Release date to be decided, codename to be selected)

- Changed how the builtin signals are subscribed to skip non Flask-SQLAlchemy
  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
- Added working table reflection support.
- Enabled autoflush by default.
