Changelog
=========

Version 2.2
-----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`#328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`#364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`#373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`#409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`#443`_)
- Don't let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`#460`_)
- Drop support of Flask < 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`#461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`#467`_)
- Added the ``auto_table_names`` arg to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor
  which can be used to disable table name generation. (`#476`_)

- Add support for binds parameter to session.

Version 2.0
-----------

  for customizing session creation.
