Version 3.0.0
-------------

Unreleased

-   Drop support for Python 2, 3.4, and 3.5.
-   Bump minimum version of Flask to 1.0.4.
-   Bump minimum version of SQLAlchemy to 1.2.
-   Remove previously deprecated code.
-   The CamelCase to snake_case table name converter handles more
    patterns correctly. If such a name was already created in the
    database, either use Alembic to rename the table, or set
    ``__tablename__`` to keep the old name. :issue:`406`
-   Set ``SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS`` to ``False`` by default.
    :pr:`727`
-   Remove default ``'sqlite:///:memory:'`` setting for
    ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI``, raise error when both it and
    ``SQLALCHEMY_BINDS`` are unset. :pr:`731`
-   Configuring SQLite with a relative path is relative to
    ``app.instance_path`` instead of ``app.root_path``. The instance
    folder is created if necessary. :issue:`462`
-   Deprecate ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` as it can cause various
    design issues that are difficult to debug. Call
    ``db.session.commit()`` directly instead. :issue:`216`
-   Change the default MySQL character set to "utf8mb4". :issue:`875`
-   Add `bind_key` to reflected tables. :issue:`660`


Version 2.5.1
-------------

Released 2021-03-18

-   Fix compatibility with Python 2.7.


Version 2.5.0
-------------

Released 2021-03-18

-   Update to support SQLAlchemy 1.4.
-   SQLAlchemy ``URL`` objects are immutable. Some internal methods have
    changed to return a new URL instead of ``None``. :issue:`885`


Version 2.4.4
-------------

Released 2020-07-14

-   Change base class of meta mixins to ``type``. This fixes an issue
    caused by a regression in CPython 3.8.4. :issue:`852`


Version 2.4.3
-------------

Released 2020-05-26

-   Deprecate ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` as it can cause various
    design issues that are difficult to debug. Call
    ``db.session.commit()`` directly instead. :issue:`216`


Version 2.4.2
-------------

Released 2020-05-25

-   Fix bad pagination when records are de-duped. :pr:`812`


Version 2.4.1
-------------

Released 2019-09-24

-   Fix ``AttributeError`` when using multiple binds with polymorphic
    models. :pr:`651`


Version 2.4.0
-------------

Released 2019-04-24

-   Make engine configuration more flexible. (:pr:`684`)
-   Address SQLAlchemy 1.3 deprecations. (:pr:`684`)
-   ``get_or_404()`` and ``first_or_404()`` now accept a ``description``
    parameter to control the 404 message. (:issue:`636`)
-   Use ``time.perf_counter`` for Python 3 on Windows. (:issue:`638`)
-   Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.3. (:pr:`687`)
-   Add an example of Flask's tutorial project, Flaskr, adapted for
    Flask-SQLAlchemy. (:pr:`720`)


Version 2.3.2
-------------

Released 2017-10-11

-   Don't mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models.
    (:pr:`561`)


Version 2.3.1
-------------

Released 2017-10-05

-   If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the
    metadata, use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables
    were not picked up by models. (:issue:`551`)
-   Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary
    key. (:pr:`556`)
-   Fix ``repr`` on models that don't have an identity because they have
    not been flushed yet. (:issue:`555`)
-   Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid
    users specifying high values in the request args. (:pr:`542`)
-   For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for
    ``page`` is 1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (:issue:`558`)


Version 2.3.0
-------------

Released 2017-09-28

-   Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names
    will be generated for models that define a primary key, but not for
    single-table inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a
    ``declared_attr``. ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected.
    (:pr:`541`)
-   Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
    ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of
    creating one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to
    construct the base. (:issue:`546`)
-   The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension
    uses for binds and table name generation have been refactored to
    work as mixins. Documentation is added about how to create a custom
    metaclass that does not do table name generation. (:issue:`546`)
-   Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
    ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old
    name will be removed in 3.0. (:issue:`546`)
-   Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary
    key. (:pr:`530`)
-   Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to
    always use the ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created
    for. This caused issues when multiple apps were registered with the
    extension. (:pr:`547`)


Version 2.2
-----------

Released 2017-02-27, codename Dubnium

-   Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of
    ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
-   Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
    to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (:pr:`328`)
-   Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``.
    (:pr:`364`)
-   Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (:pr:`373`)
-   Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (:issue:`409`)
-   Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (:pr:`443`)
-   Don't let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (:issue:`460`)
-   Drop support of Flask < 0.10. This means the db session is always
    tied to the app context and its teardown event. (:issue:`461`)
-   Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties
    unless they are ``declared_attr``. (:issue:`467`)


Version 2.1
-----------

Released 2015-10-23, codename Caesium

-   Table names are automatically generated in more cases, including
    subclassing mixins and abstract models.
-   Allow using a custom MetaData object.
-   Add support for binds parameter to session.


Version 2.0
-----------

Released 2014-08-29, codename Bohrium

-   Changed how the builtin signals are subscribed to skip
    non-Flask-SQLAlchemy sessions. This will also fix the attribute
    error about model changes not existing.
-   Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are
    tracked.
-   Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
    for customizing session creation.
-   If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will
    no longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
-   Added working table reflection support.
-   Enabled autoflush by default.
-   Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from
    docs.


Version 1.0
-----------

Released 2013-07-20, codename Aurum

-   Added Python 3.3 support.
-   Dropped 2.5 compatibility.
-   Various bugfixes
-   Changed versioning format to do major releases for each update now.

------------

-   Added session support for multiple databases.


Version 0.14
------------

-   Make relative sqlite paths relative to the application root.


Version 0.13
------------

-   Fixed an issue with Flask-SQLAlchemy not selecting the correct
    binds.


Version 0.12
------------

-   Added support for multiple databases.
-   Expose ``BaseQuery`` as ``db.Query``.
-   Set default ``query_class`` for ``db.relation``,
    ``db.relationship``, and ``db.dynamic_loader`` to ``BaseQuery``.
-   Improved compatibility with Flask 0.7.


Version 0.11
------------

-   Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.


Version 0.10
------------

-   Added support for signals.
-   Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
    overridden.
-   ``Model.query`` now always works for applications directly passed to
    the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. Furthermore the property now raises
    a ``RuntimeError`` instead of being ``None``.
-   Added session options to constructor.
-   Fixed a broken ``__repr__``.
-   ``db.Table`` is now a factory function that creates table objects.
    This makes it possible to omit the metadata.


Version 0.9
-----------

-   Applied changes to pass the Flask extension approval process.


Version 0.8
-----------

-   Added a few configuration keys for creating connections.
-   Automatically activate connection recycling for MySQL connections.
