Version 2.3.2
-------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don't mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`#561`_)

.. _#561: https://github.com/pallets/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561


Version 2.3.1
-------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`#551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`#556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don't have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`#555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`#542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`#558`_)

Version 2.3.0
-------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`#541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`#546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`#546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`#546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`#530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`#547`_)

Version 2.2
-----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`#328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`#364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`#373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`#409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`#443`_)
- Don't let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`#460`_)
- Drop support of Flask < 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`#461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`#467`_)

Version 2.0

  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
