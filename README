    ~ What is Flask-SQLAlchemy?

      Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask microframework extension which adds
      support for the SQLAlchemy SQL toolkit/ORM.

    ~ What's the latest version?

      2.0 is the most recent stable version. 2.1 is slated for release in early February. 
      
    ~ What do I need?

      SQLAlchemy, and Flask 0.10 or later. `pip` or `easy_install` will
      install them for you if you do `pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy`.
      We encourage you to use a virtualenv. Check the docs for complete
      installation and usage instructions.

    ~ Where are the docs?

      Go to http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/ for a prebuilt version
      of the current documentation.  Otherwise build them yourself
      from the sphinx sources in the docs folder.

    ~ Where are the tests?

      Good that you're asking. To run the tests use the
      `test_sqlalchemy.py` file:

        $ python test_sqlalchemy.py

      If you just want one particular testcase to run you can provide
      it on the command line:

        $ python test_sqlalchemy.py PaginationTestCase
        
      In case you have `tox` installed, you can also run that to have
      virtualenvs created automatically and tests run inside of them
      at your convenience. Running just `tox` is enough:
      
        $ tox
